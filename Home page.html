                    10-19 years, which would target their nutrition, reproductive health and substance abuse, among other
                    issues.
                </p>

                <p>The Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram was launched on 7th January, 2014. The key principle of this
                    programme is adolescent participation and leadership, Equity and inclusion, Gender Equity and strategic
                    partnerships with other sectors and stakeholders. The programme envisions enabling all adolescents in India
                    to realize their full potential by making informed and responsible decisions related to their health and
                    well-being and by accessing the services and support they need to do so.

                        title="United Nations Population Fund">UNFPA</abbr> has developed a National Adolescent Health Strategy.
                    It realigns the existing clinic-based curative approach to focus on a more holistic model based on a
                    continuum of care for adolescent health and developmental needs.
                </p>
                <p> The Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (National Adolescent Health Programme), will comprehensively address
                    the health needs of the 243 million adolescents. It introduces community-based interventions through peer
                    educators, and is underpinned by collaborations with other ministries and state governments.
